# KUBE #

In order to recreate the Kubernetes instance, we use the MicroK8s package
provided by Canonical. It is a snap package that is installed with a single
command.

In additional, applications need to be deployed.  Since these steps are
relatively simple, they have been encapsulated in a single Ansible playbook.
